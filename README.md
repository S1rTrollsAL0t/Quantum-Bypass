# Quantum-Bypass
FE Bypass is a method used in Roblox to override Filtering Enabled (FE) restrictions, allowing client-side changes to replicate on the server. Normally, FE prevents exploiters from modifying the game environment, but with a proper bypass, these restrictions can be sidestepped, making local modifications appear server-sided.

The trick behind an FE Bypass is simple: it takes advantage of remote event vulnerabilities, replication loopholes, or unpatched exploits to push unauthorized actions to the server. This can include spawning objects, executing fake animations, or even modifying character physics. By disguising altered client data as legitimate server interactions, the game treats these changes as if they were meant to happen.

While Roblox constantly updates security to patch FE exploits, new bypass methods keep appearing. Some rely on obfuscation, event spoofing, or exploiting lag compensation, making them harder to detect. At the end of the day, if the server thinks it did it, it must be real, right?
